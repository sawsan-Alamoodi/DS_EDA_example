**Descriptive Statistics**
```{r chickavg}
#food-wise mean and standard deviation
t<- chickwts %>% 
  group_by(feed) %>% 
  summarise(n=length(feed),avg = mean(weight), SD=sd(weight)) 
datatable(t)

```
 **Plots**

```{r chickbox , echo=FALSE}
#weight as described by feed presented in boxplot:
ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```


```{r chickjit , echo=FALSE}
#Summary statistics and raw values:

ggplot(chickwts, aes(x = feed, y = weight)) +
  geom_jitter(width = 0.30) +
  stat_summary(fun.data = mean_sdl, 
               fun.args = list(mult = 1), 
               col = "red") 
```

```{r}
#
chickwts %>%
  group_by(feed) %>%
  mutate(Z_score = scale(weight))
```


**Inferential Statistics**

The one-way ANOVA summary:
```{r chicklm , echo=FALSE}
#Applying a linear model this will calculate an ANOVA table on the linear model of weight described by feed to tell if the results are significant 
chickwts_lm <- lm(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts)
chickwts_lm

datatable(anova(chickwts_lm))
```

 
Tukeyâ€™s Post-hoc test:
```{r chickAv , echo=FALSE}
#to studentized range distribution
chickwts.av <-aov(weight ~ feed , data = chickwts)
tukeyTest <- TukeyHSD(chickwts.av)
datatable(tukeyTest$feed)
